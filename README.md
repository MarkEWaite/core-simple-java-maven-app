# CloudBees Core Simple Java Maven Application

This repository is for the CloudBees Core on modern cloud platforms
Intermediate course.

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `scripts` subdirectory contains a shell script with commands that
are executed when Jenkins processes the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
